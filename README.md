# passwordchecker
 This programm checks if any of your passwords was hacked.

 It reads all Passwords given in a txt file and uses the pwnedpassword.com API to check if the passwords were leaked.
 For every password it return a text saying if it was leaked and if so how many times.

 Start to programm by typing:

 passwords.txt can be named differently but should contain the passwords.
